# CustomerSegmentation
Perform customer segmentation using bank data into distinct categories based on their behavioural patterns

# Learning Objectives
At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

Understand clustering
Find groups or clusters using K-means algorithm
Visualize the high-dimensional data to low-dimensional data (2D) by applying t-SNE algorithm

# Domain Information
1. Customer segmentation refers to the process of dividing a set of potential customers into groups (or segments) based on shared attributes, interests, and behaviors.
2. One of the key pain points for bank marketing team is to know their customers and identify their needs.
3. For this mini-hackathon, we will use the popular K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their behavior from the bank data. The basic concept is that consumers who share common traits would respond to marketing communication in a similar way so that the bank marketing team can reach out to each group in a relevant and effective way.

# Description
The dataset chosen is the behavior of customers in the bank for 6 months, this dataset is made up of 13 features.
